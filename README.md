Prerequisites 
PSTAT   120A, PSTAT   120B   which   serve   as   the   foundation   for   probability   and   statistics.
Course Website 
Everything   related   to   this   course   will   be   posted   on   Canvas   PSTAT   160A-F24.
Textbook The required textbook is   “Introduction to Stochastic Processes with R" by   Robert   P.   Dobrow.    The   free   electronic   copy   is   available   in   the   UCSB   digital   library.    Some   assignments   will   be   assigned   from   this   book.
Grading Breakdown 
• Assignments:   20%
• Quizzes:   20%
• Midterm:   25%
• Final   Exam:   35%
Assignments 
•    There   will   be   5   assignments.    No   coding   is   requested   in   assignments.    Assignments   will   be   posted   on   Canvas   as the   course progresses   and you   will be   given   sufﬁcient   time   to   complete   each   of them  代 写PSTAT 160A: Stochastic Process: Fall 2024
代做程序编程语言 (see the   deadline   details   on each   assignment).    All   assignments need to be   sub-   mitted via Gradescope.
•    Grading:   The total   score for each assignment is   40   points.   Two   problems   in   each   assignment   will be randomly chosen and graded based   on their   correctness   (10   points   each),   while   credit   for completeness will be given for the remaining problems.   The lowest assignment   score will   be dropped.
•    Late   Submission   Policy:    Late   submission   can   be   accepted   within   2   days   after   the   deadline   with   a   20% late   penalty.   No   assignments   will   be   accepted   after   this   period.
Quizzes/Tests 
•    There   will   be   3 quizzes   and   the   lowest   quiz   score   will   be   dropped.   Each   quiz   takes   about   15   minutes   (at   the   end   of   the   lecture),   and   has   a   total   score   of   20   points.   The   Mid-term   test   will be   for   75 minutes   (no   lecture   on   that   day) and   carries   50 points.   They   are   designed   to   test   your knowledge and understanding of the basic concepts and methods discussed in the lectures.
